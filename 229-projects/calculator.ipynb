For the most part there is no\n    surprise, once you learn the notations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^`.\n    (Though you may find that copying and pasting minus signs will often\n    cause an error, as only something that looks like a minus sign is\n    pasted in.)\n\nUsing `IJulia`, one types the following into a cell, and then presses\nthe \"run\" button (or \"shift-enter\"):\n\n","metadata":{}},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","languge":"python","metadata":{},"input":"2 + 2","collapsed":"false"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The answer follows below the cell.\nHere is how one does a slightly more complicated computation:\n\n","metadata":{}},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","languge":"python","metadata":{},"input":"(2 + 3)^4/(5 + 6)","collapsed":"false"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As with your calculator, it is very important to use parentheses as\nappropriate to circumvent the usual order of operations.\n-   The use of the basic families of function: trigonometric,\n    exponential, logarithmic.\n\nOn a calculator, there are buttons used to compute various functions.

(One can only\ntake the factorial of 20 with 64-bit integers, whereas on most\ncalculators a factorial of 69 can be taken, but not 70.) Julia\nautomatically assigns a type when it parses a value. a `1` will be an\ninteger, a `1.0` an floating point number. Rational numbers are made by\nusing two division symbols, `1//2`.\nFor many operations the type will be conserved, such as adding to\nintegers. For some operations, the type will be converted, such as\ndividing two integer values. Mathematically, we know we can divide some\nintegers and still get an integer, but `julia` usually opts for the same\noutput for its functions (and division is also a function) based on the\ntype of the input, not the values of the input.\n\nOkay, maybe that is too much.
