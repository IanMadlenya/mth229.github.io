\section{Questions to be handed in for project 7:}

To get started, we load \texttt{Gadfly} so that we can make plots, and
load the \texttt{Roots} package for \texttt{D} and \texttt{fzero}:



\begin{verbatim}
using Gadfly            
using Roots         
\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection{Quick background}

Read about this material here:
\href{http://mth229.github.io/first-second-derivatives.html}{Exploring
first and second derivatives with Julia}.

For the impatient, this assignment looks at the relationship between a
function, $f(x)$, and its first and second derivatives, $f'(x)$ and
$f''(x)$. The basic relationship can be summarized (though the devil is
in the details) by:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  if the first derivative is \emph{positive} on $(a,b)$ then the
  function is \emph{increasing} on $(a,b)$.
\item
  If the second derivative is \emph{positive} on $(a,b)$ then the
  function is \emph{concave up} on $(a,b)$.
\end{enumerate}

As well, use the definition of a \emph{critical point} being a value in
the domain of $f(x)$ for which the derivative is $0$ or undefined.

We can use the \texttt{D} operator from the \texttt{Roots} package to
find the first and second derivatives of \texttt{f}. The usage follows
this pattern:



\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = sin(x)           # some function
fp(x) = D(f)(x)         # makes fp the first derivative, though using D(f) is maybe better.
fpp(x) = D(f,2)(x)      # makes fpp the second derivative, though using D(f,2) is maybe better.
\end{verbatim}
In the notes, the following function is used to plot a function
\texttt{f} two ways: once as usual, the second time showing the function
\texttt{f} \emph{only if} the function \texttt{g} is positive.



\begin{verbatim}
function plotif(f, g, a, b)
  plot([f, x -> g(x) > 0.0 ? f(x) : NaN], a, b)
end
\end{verbatim}
This allows a graphical exploration of the above facts:



\begin{verbatim}
plotif(f, D(F), 0, 2pi)     # shows sin(x) and when its derivative is 0
\end{verbatim}
Clicking on the \texttt{f1} in the legend on the right will hide the
entire graph of \texttt{f} and leave only the graph of \texttt{f} where
\texttt{fp(x) \textgreater{} 0}. That is, where $f$ is known to be
increasing by the basic fact above.



Many questions resolve to finding zeros of some function. The
\texttt{fzeros} function can be useful for this -{}- but it only finds
simple roots. A repeated use of \texttt{fzero} with good initial guesses
is more reliable. For example, from the graph of
$f(x) = 1 + \cos(x) + \cos(2x)$, we can see in $[0,2\pi]$ that there are
zeros \emph{near} 1.5, 2, 4 and 5. These can be improved with:



\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = 1 + cos(x) + cos(2x)
guesses = [1.5, 2, 4, 5]
[fzero(f, x) for x in guesses] # do 4 things at once
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Finding numeric values}

As a reminder, a \emph{critical} point of $f$ is a value in the domain
of $f(x)$ for which the derivative is $0$ or undefined. An
\emph{inflection point} is a point where the concavity of $f$ changes.
(These are \emph{often} but \textbf{not always} where $f''(x)=0$.)

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  We can graphically identify \emph{critical points} of $f(x)$ by
  graphing the function's derivative and looking for when the derivative
  is 0 or undefined. Numerically, we can locate values where the
  derivative crosses $0$ using the \texttt{fzero} function from the
  \texttt{Roots} package.
\end{itemize}

Use \texttt{fzero} to numerically identify all \emph{critical points} to
the function $f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 - 2x + 4$. (There are no more than
$2$.)

\begin{answer}
type: longtext
reminder: critical points of \( f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 - 2x + 4 \)

  interval notation in your answer.
\end{itemize}

labels: (-oo, oo) -- it is always concave up | (1.5, oo) | (1.0, 2.0) | (-oo, 1.0) and (2.0, oo)
answer: 4
\end{answer}

\subsubsection{The derivative tests}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The first derivative test states that for a differentiable function
  $f(x)$ with a critical point at $c$ then if $f'(x)$ changes sign from
  $+$ to $-$ at $c$ then $f(c)$ is a local maximum and if it changes
  sign from $-$ to $+$ then $f(c)$ is a local minimum.
\end{itemize}

For the function $f(x)$ suppose you know $f'(x)=x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x - 4$.
Find \emph{all} the critical points. Use the first derivative test to
classify them as local extrema \emph{if} you can. If you can't say why.

\begin{answer}
type: longtext
reminder: Find critical points of f(x), when \( f'(x)=x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x -4 \). Classify
answer_text: 1,2 are cps, changes sign - to + at 1, so a min; does not change sign at 2, not an extrema 
rows: 3
cols: 60
\end{answer}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The second derivative test states that if $c$ is a critical point of
  $f(x)$ and $f''(c) > 0$ then $f(c)$ is a local minimum and if
  $f''(c) < 0$ then $f(c)$ is a local maximum.
\end{itemize}

Suppose $f'(x) = (x^2 - 2) \cdot e^{-x}$. First find the critical points
of $f(x)$, then use the second derivative test to classify them.

\end{answer}

\subsubsection{Concave up has alternate definitions}

The Rogawski book defines $f(x)$ to be concave up for differentiable
functions by:

\begin{quote}
$f(x)$ is concave up on $(a,b)$ if $f'(x)$ is increasing on $(a,b)$.
\end{quote}

More generally, one can define $f(x)$ as concave up on $(a,b)$ if for
any pair of points, $c$ and $d$ with $a < c < d < b$ one has the secant
line connecting $(c,f(c))$ and $(d,f(d))$ lies \emph{above} the graph of
$f(x)$ over $(c,d)$.

For the function $f(x) = x^2 - 2x$, graphically verify this is the case
for 3 pairs of points between $(-5,5)$. The following can be used to
create a function for a secant line between $c$ and $d$:



\begin{verbatim}
function secline(f, c, d)
  x0, y0, m = c, f(c), (f(c) - f(d)) / (c - d)
  x -> y0 + m * (x - x0)    # pt-slope form as function
end
\end{verbatim}
