\section{Questions to be handed in on Newton's Method:}

Begin by loading our package for plotting and the Roots package

\subsubsection{Quick background}

Read about this material here:
\href{http://mth229.github.io/newton.html}{Newton's Method}.

For the impatient, symbolic math -{}- as is done behind the scenes at
the Wolfram alpha web site -{}- is pretty nice. For so many problems it
can easily do what is tedious work. However, for some questions, only
numeric solutions are possible. For example, there is no general formula
to solve a fifth order polynomial, the way there is a quadratic formula.
Even an innocuous polynomial like $f(x) = x^5 - x - 1$ has no easy
algebraic solution:



\begin{verbatim}
using SymPy         # a symbolic math program
x = Sym("x")
solve(x^5 - x - 1)
\end{verbatim}
We see that \texttt{SymPy} basically punts on this question.

Numeric solutions are available. As this is a polynomial, we could use
the \texttt{roots} function:



\begin{verbatim}
roots(f)
\end{verbatim}
We see 5 roots -{}- as expected from a fifth degree polynomial -{}- with
one real root (the one with \texttt{0.0im}) that is approximately
1.1673. Finding such a value usually requires some root-finding
algorithm.

Newton's method is a root-finding algorithm like the bisection method
discussed earlier. As an \emph{algorithm} it starts with some
\emph{guess} for a \emph{root} to an equation $f(x) = 0$. If this guess
is called $x_0$, then the algorithm gives a \emph{new (and improved)}
guess $x_1$. It is expected that $x_1$ is a better guess, but may not be
the best that can be. The algorithm is then repeated \emph{again} to
produce $x_2$. This is done until some guess $x_n$ is as close as we can
get or the algorithm fails for some reason. The \emph{approximate root}
is taken to be $x_n$.

What is the algorithm? It is simple. If we start with some $x_i$, then
$x_{i+1}$ is given by the intersection point of the $x$-axis of the
tangent line of $f(x)$ at $x_i$. See a figure
{[}here{]}(http://mth229.github.io/newton.html\#\_basic\_idea\_{]}.
Mathematically then we can equate our two means to compute the slope of
a tangent line:

\[
f'(x_i) = \frac{f(x_i) - 0}{x_i - x_{i+1}}
\]

Or, solving for $x_{i+1}$:

\[
x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i)/f'(x_i)
\]

Let's see this algorithm for \texttt{f(x) = x\^{}3−2x−5}, a function
that Newton considered. He was looking for a solution near $2$, so let's
start there:



\begin{verbatim}
x = 2
f(x) = x^3 - 2x -5
fp(x) = 3x^2 - 2        # done by hand
\end{verbatim}
We don't need to track the index ($x_0$, $x_1$, ...) as when we write
the following expression, the next value is just assigned to \texttt{x}
using the \emph{current} value of \texttt{x} when computed:



\begin{verbatim}
x = x - f(x) / fp(x)
x, f(x)             # display both the new guess, x,  and the value f(x)
\end{verbatim}
The value of $2.1$ is a better guess, but not near the actual answer. We
simply repeat to (hopefully) get a better guess:



\begin{verbatim}
x = x - f(x) / fp(x)
x, f(x)
\end{verbatim}
Here are a few repeats:



\begin{verbatim}
x = x - f(x) / fp(x)
x, f(x)
\end{verbatim}


\begin{verbatim}
x = x - f(x) / fp(x)
x, f(x)
\end{verbatim}
The value of \texttt{f(x)} is now \emph{basically} 0, and any further
updates to \texttt{x} do not change its value. We see that the algorithm
has converged to an answer, \texttt{x}, and the fact that it is a zero
is confirmed by the value of \texttt{f(x)}.

Repeating steps in \texttt{IJulia} can be a bit of a chore, so here we
define a \emph{macro} to repeat some expression 5 times and then show
how to use it. (A macro does not evaluate its expression immediately,
unlike functions.)



\begin{verbatim}
macro take5(body) quote [$(esc(body)) for _ in 1:5] end end # take5 macro
\end{verbatim}
Macros are prefaced with a \texttt{@} in their name and are typically
called without parentheses:



\begin{verbatim}
@take5     x = x - f(x) / fp(x)
\end{verbatim}
We now show how we can get the above in a more efficient manner:



\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = x^3 - 2x -5
x = 2               # initial guess
fp(x) = 3x^2 - 2

@take5  x = x - f(x)/fp(x)
(x, f(x))           # has converged, as f(x) is basically 0
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Using \texttt{D} for the derivative}

If the function \texttt{f(x)} allows it, the \texttt{D} operator from
the \texttt{Roots} package can simplify the Newton's method algorithm,
as the derivative need not be computed by hand. In this case, the
algorithm in \texttt{julia} becomes \texttt{x = x - f(x)/D(f)(x)}.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Use Newton's method to find an intersection point of
  $f(x) =   e^{-x^2}$ and $g(x)=x$. (Look at $h(x) = f(x) - g(x) = 0$.)
  Start with a guess of $0$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{answer}
    type: numeric

\item

  guesses.

\begin{answer}
    type: numeric
    reminder: larger zero
    answer: [2.6178666030668127, 2.6178666230668126]

\end{answer}

\subsubsection{using \texttt{newton} and \texttt{fzero} from the
\texttt{Roots} package}

The \texttt{newton} function in the \texttt{Roots} package will compute
newton's method. For example:



\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = sin(x)
fp(x) = cos(X)
x = 3
newton(f, fp, x)
\end{verbatim}
However, the \texttt{fzero} function -{}- that we have seen before -{}-
will use a derivative-free algorithm, similar to Newton's method to find
a zero. So, the above could be achieved with:



\begin{verbatim}
fzero(sin, 3)
\end{verbatim}
(That is right, \texttt{fzero} can be used two different ways -{}- at
least. Above it is called with an initial guess. Previously, we called
it with a bracketing interval, as in \texttt{fzero(sin, {[}3,4{]})}. If
you specify a bracketing interval, \texttt{fzero} will use an algorithm
guaranteed to converge. If you just specify an initial guess, the
convergence is generally faster, but may not happen.)

\end{answer}

\subsubsection{When Newton's method fails}

Newton's method can fail due to various cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  the initial guess is not close to the zero
\item
  the derivative, $\vert f'(x)\vert $ is too small
\item
  the second derivative $\vert f''(x)\vert $ is too big
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Let $f(x) = x^5 - x - 1$. Try Newton's method with an initial guess of
  $x_0=0$. Why does this fail? (You can look graphically. Otherwise, you
  could look at the output of \texttt{newton} with this extra argument:
  \texttt{newton(f, fp, x0, verbose=true)}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{answer}
type: longtext
reminder: Why does Newton's method fail?
answer_text: Too flat, or f'(x) is too small 
rows: 3
cols: 60
\end{answer}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Let \texttt{f(x) = abs(x)\^{}(1/3)}. Starting at \texttt{x=1},
  Newton's method will fail to converge. What happens? Are any of the
  above 3 reason's to blame?
\end{itemize}

\begin{answer}
type: longtext
reminder: Why does Newton's method fail?
answer_text: f'' doesn't exist, basically too big 
rows: 3
cols: 60
\end{answer}

\subsubsection{Quadratic convergence}

When Newton's method converges to a \emph{simple zero} it is said to
have \emph{quadratic convergence}. A simple zero is one with
multiplicity 1 and quadratic convergence says basically that the error
at the $i+1$st step is like the error for $i$th step squared. In
particular, if the error is like $10^{-3}$ on one step, it will be like
$10^{-6}$, then $10^{-12}$ then $10^{-24}$ on subsequent steps. (Which
is typically beyond the limit of a floating point approximation.) This
is why one can \emph{usually} take just 5 steps to get to an answer.

Not so for multiple roots.

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  For the function \texttt{f(x) = (8x*exp(-x\^{}2) -2x - 3)\^{}8},
  starting with \texttt{x=-2.0} Newton's method will converge, but it
  will take many steps to get to an answer that has $f(x)$ around
  $10^{-16}$. How many? Roughly how many iterations do you need? (A
  single call of \texttt{@take5 x   = x-f(x)/D(f)(x)} gives an answer
  with \texttt{f(x) = 0.00028} only.)
\end{itemize}

\item
  Repeat the above with \texttt{f(x) = 8x*exp(-x\^{}2) -2x - 3} -{}-
  there is no extra power of $8$ here -{}- and again, starting with
