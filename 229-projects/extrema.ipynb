In calculus, we have two concepts of these\n*relative* extrema and *absolute* extrema. Let's focus for a second on\n*absolute* which are stated as:\n\n> A value $y=f(x)$ is an absolute maximum over an interval $[a,b]$ if\n> $y \\geq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$. (An absolute minimum has\n> $y \\leq f(x)$ instead.)\n\nThere are two theorems which help identify extrema here. The first, due\nto Bolzano, says that any continuous function on a *closed* interval\nwill have an absolute maximum and minimum on that interval. The second,\ndue to Fermat, tells us where to look: these absolute maximums and\nminimums can only occur at end points or critical points, then evaluate\nto determine.\n\nBolzano and Fermat are historic figures. For us, we can plot a function\nto visually see extrema. The value of Bolzano is the knowledge that yes,\nplotting isn't a waste of time, as we are *guaranteed* to see what we\nlook for. The value of Fermat is that if you want to get *precise*\nnumeric answers, you have a means: identify the end points and the\ncritical points then compare.\n\nThe notes walk you through the task of finding among all rectangles with\nperimeter 20 the one with maximum area. This is done quickly via:\n\n","metadata":{}},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","languge":"python","metadata":{},"input":"A(b, h) = h * b             # base times height is area\n## From P = 2b + 2h -> h = (P -2b)/2\nh(b) = (20 - 2b)/2      # Relates perimeter, height, base\nA(b) = A(b, h(b))       # substitution step: express Area in terms of b alone\nx = fzero(D(A), [0, 10])    # critical point of A(b) on its domain\nf(0), f(x), f(10)","collapsed":"false"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here `x` is a critical point.

The original problem had two variables (a base and\na height) and a fixed relationship between them (the perimeter is 20).\nFrom this one variable can be deduced in terms of another leaving us a\ncontinuous function (`A`) with extrema of interest (in this case the\nmaximum).\nNotice how `julia` makes this easy: the substitution step of math is\ndone using **composition** of functions and leverages the fact that\n`julia`, using *multiple dispatch*, can give the function `A` different\nmeanings depending on the number (and type) of its arguments: with one\nargument, the area is a function of the base `b` with two arguments, the\narea is a function of the base and the height.\n\nTo solve for the $x$-value corresponding to the extrema, we used `fzero`\nwith bracketing, as it is guaranteed to converge and it is clear that\nthe interval $[0,10]$ is a bracket for the derivative function. We could\nalso have identified a good initial guess for the maximum from the\ngraph, say 5, and just called `fzero` with this initial guess, as\n`fzero(D(A), 5)`.\n\n### Questions\n\nFor the following questions (which were cribbed from various internet\nsources), find the most precise answer you can, a graphical solution is\nnot enough, use one of the zero-finding methods to get as accurate\nanswer you can.\n\n-   <em>Ye olde post office</em>\n\nA box with a square base is taller than it is wide.
