\section{Questions to be handed in for project 3:}

Read about this here:
\href{http://mth229.github.io/graphing.html}{Graphing Functions with
Julia}.

For the impatient, \texttt{julia} has several packages that allow for
graphical presentations, but nothing "built-in." We will use the
\texttt{Gadfly} package for producing graphics. Assuming it has been
installed, we need to load it into a session as follows:



\begin{verbatim}
using Gadfly 
\end{verbatim}
This brings in a \texttt{plot} function that makes plotting functions as
easy as specifying a function object and the $x$ limits to plot over:



\begin{verbatim}
plot(sin, 0, 2pi)       # plot(f, a, b)
\end{verbatim}
Often most of the battle is \emph{judiciously} choosing the values of
$a$ and $b$ so that the graph highlights a feature of interest (a zero,
a relative peak or valley, an intersection point, ...).

A plot is nothing more than a connect-the-dot graph of $x$ and $y$
values. It can be useful to know how to do the steps. The above could be
done with:



\begin{verbatim}
a, b = 0, 2pi
xs = linspace(a, b)     # 100 points between a and b
ys = [sin(x) for x in xs]   # or ys = map(sin, xs) (see the notes)
plot(x=xs, y=ys, Geom.line) # Geom.line connects the points. Try without to see.
\end{verbatim}
The \texttt{xs} and \texttt{ys} are written as though they are "plural"
because these variables contain 100 values each in a container (a vector
in this case). Containers (vectors in this case) are often constructed
by combining like values within square brackets separated by commas:
e.g., \texttt{{[}a,b{]}}. For plotting, we can combine functions using
\texttt{{[}{]}} and all will plot:



\begin{verbatim}
plot([sin, cos], 0, 2pi)
\end{verbatim}
