\section{Questions to be handed in for project 5 on limits}

To get started, we load \texttt{Gadfly} so that we can make plots.

\subsubsection{Quick background}

Read about this material here:
\href{http://mth229.github.io/limits.html}{Investigating limits with
Julia}.

For the impatient, the expression

\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = L
\]

says that the limit as $x$ goes to $c$ of $f$ is $L$. If $f(x)$ is
\emph{continuous} at $x=c$, the $L=f(c)$. This is almost always the case
for a randomly chosen $c$ - but almost never the case for a textbook
choice of $c$. There invariably -{}- though not always -{}- we will have
\texttt{f(c) = NaN} indicating the function is indeterminate at
\texttt{c}. For such cases we need to do more work to identify if any
such $L$ exists and when it does, what its value is.

We can investigate limits three ways: analytically, with a table of
numbers, or graphically. Here we focus on two ways: graphically or
numerically.

Investigating a limit numerically requires us to operationalize the idea
of $x$ getting close to $c$ and $f(x)$ getting close to $L$. The first
is easy: just create numbers getting close to 0:



\begin{verbatim}
xs = [(1/10)^i for i in 1:10]
\end{verbatim}
Then we can investigate limits by looking the corresponding
\texttt{f(x)} values. For example, the limit of $\sin(x)/x$ near $0$ is
investigated with:



\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = sin(x)/x
ys = [f(x) for x in xs]     # y values. Alternatively ys = map(f, xs)
[xs ys]             # arrange in a table
\end{verbatim}
From this we see a \emph{right} limit at 0 appears to be $1$. (Look at
what happens to the column on the right.)

Limits when $c\neq 0$ are similar, but require points getting close to
$c$. For example,

\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow \pi/2} \frac{1 - \sin(x)}{(\pi/2 - x)^2}
\]

has a limit of $1/2$. We can investigate with:



\begin{verbatim}
c = pi/2
xs = [c + (1/10)^i for i in 1:10]
f(x) = (1 - sin(x))/(pi/2 - x)^2
ys = map(f, xs)
[xs ys]
\end{verbatim}
Wait, is the limit $1/2$ or $0$? Here we see a limitation of tables -{}-
when numbers get too small, floating point issues creep in. In this
case, when the difference of \texttt{x} from \texttt{pi/2} gets to be
\texttt{1e-8} the difference between \texttt{1} and \texttt{sin(x)} is
too small to have a floating point number other than \texttt{1}
represent \texttt{sin(x)}, hence the numerator becomes $0$. So watch out
when seeing what the values of $f(x)$ get close to. Here it is clear
that the limit is heading towards $0.5$ until we get too close.

For convenience, this function can make the above easier to do:



\begin{verbatim}
function lim(f::Function, c::Real; n::Int=6, dir="+")
     hs = [(1/10)^i for i in 1:n] # close to 0
     if dir == "+"
       xs = c + hs 
     else
       xs = c - hs
     end
     ys = map(f, xs)
     [xs ys]
end
\end{verbatim}
A graphical approach doesn't give as many significant digits, but won't
have this floating point error. Here is a graph to investigate the same
problem. We simply graph near $c$ and look:



\begin{verbatim}
plot(f, c - pi/6, c + pi/6)
\end{verbatim}
From the graph, we see clearly that as $x$ is close to $\pi/2$, $f(x)$
is close to $1/2$. (Gadfly either doesn't include a point for \texttt{c}
or ignores that value when present by treating it like \texttt{NaN}.)

\subsection{Questions: Tables}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  These expressions are all \emph{indeterminate} at $c=0$ (that is, the
  limit -{}- should it exist -{}- is not found by continuity). Which
  return \texttt{NaN} if you try to evaluate them at $0$?
\end{itemize}

\[
\frac{1-\cos(x)}{x}, \quad, x^{1/\log(x)}, \quad \frac{\tan(x)}{x},\quad x\log(x).
\]

\begin{answer}
type: longtext

\end{answer}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Let $c=0$. Which of these functions is indeterminate at $x=c$:
\end{itemize}

\[
f(x) = \sin(x)/x, \quad
f(x) = \sqrt{x}/(x-2), \quad
f(x) = x^x, \quad
f(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x.
\]

(In the previous problem, you found that not all indeterminate
expressions evaluate to \texttt{NaN} -{}- there is one special form
where a different value is chosen.)

\subsection{Symbolic limits}

The add-on package \texttt{SymPy} can compute the limit of a simple
algebraic function of a single variable quite well. The package is
loaded with:



\begin{verbatim}
using SymPy
\end{verbatim}
The \texttt{limit} function is called just as our \texttt{lim} function
is above. For example:



\begin{verbatim}
f(x) = sin(x)/x
limit(f, 0)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Find this limit using \texttt{SymPy} (use a decimal value for your
  answer, not a fraction):
