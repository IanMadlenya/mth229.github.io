That site uses Wolfram's `Mathematica`\nprogram, though the interface relaxes greatly the syntax of that\nprogram. Other CASs include `Maple` and `Sage`. Both `Mathematica` and\n`Maple` are available for free to CUNY students and `Sage` is free to\neveryone, as it is open source.\n\nOn top of these, there is `SymPy`, an add-on to the popular `Python`\nprogramming language.
